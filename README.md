Create a React component that functions as a countdown timer.
Hover over a message to pin it
keep
The component should contain:

An input field where the user enters a time in minutes.

A display that shows the countdown in mm:ss format.

Three buttons: Start/Pause, Stop, and Restart.
When the user enters a number (e.g., 3), clicking Start should begin the countdown from 3 minutes (03:00).

The timer should update every second.

When the timer hits 00:00, display a message like “Time’s up!”.
